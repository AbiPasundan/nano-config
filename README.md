# Nano Config

## What is This?

This is my personal nano text editor customize.

In my case I often check file using nano and in the time I feel bored look at the nano editor it's feel so boring

So I customize nano for my personal use add color highligting, minimap cutom key binding etc

## Key Binding

For key binding I cutom some key that I familiar with it

* Ctrl+S for save you can see in `bind ^S savefile main`
* Ctrl+F for search you can see in `bind ^F whereis main`
* Ctrl+Z for undo you can see in `bind ^Z undo main`
* Ctrl+Y for rendo you can see in `bind ^Y redo main`
* Ctrl+Q for exit nano you can see in `bind ^Q exit all`
